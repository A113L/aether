*"Just as the Michelson-Morley experiment of 1887 sought to measure the fundamental constants of the universe, this tool measures the fundamental performance characteristics of hashcat rules with scientific precision."*

**Overview**

A high-precision benchmarking tool that empirically measures hashcat rule performance using OpenCL acceleration. Inspired by the rigorous experimental methodology of the Michelson-Morley experiment, this tool provides statistically significant performance data to optimize password cracking rule sets.

**Scientific Approach**

Michelson-Morley Inspiration (1887)

Just as Michelson and Morley sought to measure the luminiferous ether with unprecedented precision, this tool measures rule performance with:

- Interferometric Precision: Multiple test runs with statistical outlier removal
- Null Hypothesis Testing: Rules must demonstrate consistent performance across identical conditions
- Control Variables: Identical dictionary sets for reliable comparisons
- Measurement Accuracy: Coefficient of Variation (CV) calculations to quantify uncertainty

**Key Metrics Measured**

- Execution Time (μs): Mean, median with outlier rejection
- Operations/Second: Throughput calculation
- Coefficient of Variation: Measurement stability (≤10% = excellent)
- Statistical Confidence: Multiple runs with 2-sigma outlier removal

**Features**

- Colorized Terminal Output - Instant visual performance feedback
- Statistical Robustness - Multiple test runs with outlier detection
- OpenCL GPU Acceleration - Direct kernel execution for accurate timing
- Consistency Validation - Michelson-Morley inspired identical-condition testing
- Performance Ranking - Rules sorted from fastest to slowest
- Smart Optimization - Create optimized rule sets based on empirical data

**Installation**

```
# Clone repository
wget https://github.com/A113L/aether/raw/refs/heads/main/aether.py

    -r best64.rule \
    -d rockyou.txt rockyou.txt \  # Same dictionary twice
    --identical-dicts
```

**Output Interpretation**

*Color-Coded Performance*

🟢 Green: Excellent performance (< 1ms, CV ≤ 10%)

🟡 Yellow: Good performance (1-10ms, CV ≤ 20%)

🔴 Red: Poor performance (> 10ms, CV > 20%)

**Statistical Metrics**

```
{
  "mean_time": 0.000456,      # Average execution time (seconds)
  "median_time": 0.000443,    # Median (outlier resistant)
  "std_time": 0.000023,       # Standard deviation
  "cv_percent": 5.04,         # Coefficient of Variation (%)
  "operations_per_sec": 2,193,877  # Throughput
}
```

**Experimental Methodology**

```
1. Control Conditions

# Identical dictionary sets for reliable comparisons
self.setup_test_data(args.dict, use_identical_sets=True)
2. Multiple Measurement Runs

# 5 test runs per rule with outlier removal
performance_data = self.test_single_rule_performance(rule, test_runs=5)
3. Statistical Processing

# 2-sigma outlier rejection (95% confidence)
filtered_times = [t for t in execution_times if abs(t - mean) <= 2 * std]
4. Consistency Validation

# Michelson-Morley inspired consistency checking
consistency = self.validate_rule_consistency(
    performance_run1, 
    performance_run2, 
    threshold_percent=15.0  # ≤15% difference allowed
)
```
